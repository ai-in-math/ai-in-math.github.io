<summary>The Free Burnside Group and the Burnside Problem</summary>

## Definition of the Free Burnside Group

The free Burnside group of rank $$m$$ and exponent $$n$$, denoted $$B(m, n)$$, is a group with $$m$$ distinguished generators $$x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_m$$ in which the identity $$x^n = 1$$ holds for all elements $$x$$, and which is the "largest" group satisfying these requirements.

More precisely, the characteristic property of $$B(m, n)$$ is that, given any group $$G$$ with $$m$$ generators $$g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_m$$ and of exponent $$n$$, there is a unique homomorphism from $$B(m, n)$$ to $$G$$ that maps the $$i$$-th generator $$x_i$$ of $$B(m, n)$$ into the $$i$$-th generator $$g_i$$ of $$G$$.

## Group Presentation

In the language of group presentations, the free Burnside group $$B(m, n)$$ has:
- **Generators:** $$x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_m$$
- **Relations:** $$x^n = 1$$ for each word $$x$$ in $$x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_m$$

Any group $$G$$ with $$m$$ generators of exponent $$n$$ is obtained from $$B(m, n)$$ by imposing additional relations.

The existence of the free Burnside group and its uniqueness up to an isomorphism are established by standard techniques of group theory.

## Universal Property

Thus if $$G$$ is any finitely generated group of exponent $$n$$, then $$G$$ is a homomorphic image of $$B(m, n)$$, where $$m$$ is the number of generators of $$G$$.

## The Burnside Problem

The Burnside problem for groups with bounded exponent can now be restated as follows:

> **Burnside Problem II.** For which positive integers $$m, n$$ is the free Burnside group $$B(m, n)$$ finite?

The full solution to Burnside problem in this form is not known.

## Known Results

Burnside considered some easy cases in his original paper:

1. $$B(1, n)$$ is the cyclic group of order $$n$$.

2. $$B(m, 2)$$ is the direct product of $$m$$ copies of the cyclic group of order $$2$$ and hence finite.$$^{[1]}$$

The following additional results are known (Burnside, Sanov, M. Hall):

3. $$B(m, 3)$$, $$B(m, 4)$$, and $$B(m, 6)$$ are finite for all $$m$$.

4. The particular case of $$B(2, 5)$$ remains open.
